        <h1>Read Watch Rate</h1>
        <p>This name was selected since it's a page to rate and review books and movies, so it represents reading a
            book,
            watching a movie, and rating it in the site. It's also short and catchy so people can remember it easily.
        </p>

        <h2>Purpose</h2>
        <p>This site provides a way to rate and review books and movies, it also provides the top ratings and
            recommendations from other users and creates a community of book and movie enjoyers.</p>

        <h2>Scenarios</h2>
        <p>What movie should I watch? / What book should I read?</p>
        <p>Where can I rate and review the movie I just watched/book I just read?</p>
        <p>What movies/books are popular right now?</p>

        <h2>Color Schema</h2>
        <h3>Primary color: Dark purple #442242</h3>
        <p>This color will be used for the logo and any important icons that give identity to the site.</p>
        <h3>Font color: Cornsilk #FFF6DE</h3>
        <p>This color will be used for the font on the dark background and other accents.</p>
        <h3>Accent color: Orchid Pink #E7B9C1</h3>
        <p>This color will be used in details that don't require a lot of focus.</p>
        <h3>Background color: Raisin Black #1F1E20</h3>
        <p>This will be te background color for most of the site. On light backgrounds this will be the font color.</p>

        <h2>Typography</h2>
        <h3>News Cycle</h3>
        <p>This font will be used for headings and in most of the rest of the site.</p>
        <h3>Newsreader</h3>
        <p>This font will be used for the reviews themselves. This is a newspaper type font so the reviews will look
            like an article and be easy to read. Example:</p>
        <p class="review">I actually liked this film, I think the story was good and entertaining, the pacing was good,
            there was a lot of action that I didn't expect but it was very enjoyable. It was also sad, I felt a real
            empathy for Taka, but I guess life isn't always fair and that doesn't mean you should betray your brother.
        </p>
        <p class="review">I'm not a fan of the fake live action films like this one though, this is just animation but
            worse, because
            they don't have a lot of expressions and it's sometimes difficult to differentiate the characters because
            they all look like lions, lol. </p>
        <p class="review">Overall I liked it though, especially the songs by Lin Manuel Miranda which are just always
            good! I always wanted a brothaaaaaa! </p>
